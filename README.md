### 1.1 Dataset list


## 2. Computation requirements

### 2.1 Software requirements

### 2.2 Controlled randomness


### 2.3 Memory, runtime, and storage

The machine runs on VMware Virtual Platform, on a 32-Core AMD EPYC 7543P, with Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (Focal Fossa), 5.15.0-130-generic Kernel with 192GB memory available.
Saving all stan outputs, about 35 GB memory is needed. As written, the program takes advantage of up to 16 cores, and then it runs for about 35 hours.
